                                    This app is for people who want
                                    to have a small and simple daily planner.
                                    Currently, the app has features to let
                                    the user put up tasks, set up schedules, and
                                    calculate
                                    their basal metabolic rate and body mass
                                    index. The information
                                    given is then displayed on the dashboard
                                    when the user logins.
                                    <br> <br>
                                    More features are currently being developed
                                    such as a study room
                                    where a text editor will reside that will
                                    include a Spotify player
                                    at the side. It will also offer a timer to
                                    check how long the user
                                    has been studying. Another feature planned
                                    is SMS reminders where
                                    an SMS text will be sent to the user's phone
                                    number that will
                                    include the schedule and tasks of the user
                                    for the day.
                                    <br> <br>
                                    The purpose of this app is to help people
                                    remember their tasks and goals
                                    throughout their daily lives.
