Description
---
A daily planner app that allows the user to create tasks, schedules, and calculate their basal metabolic rate and 
body mass index. It is then stored and displayed on their dashboard.

Motivation
---
I wanted to make an app that can help people with their daily tasks and goals. It also helps me since I tend to 
forget the things I need to do throughout my daily life.
